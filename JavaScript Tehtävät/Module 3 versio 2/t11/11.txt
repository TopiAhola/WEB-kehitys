Continue task 5. Folder t11 already exists. Follow the instructions in t11.txt. Modify the program to open large image in a modal when <article> is clicked. (6p)

<dialog>
   <span>&#x2715;</span>
   <img>
</dialog>

use showModal() and close() functions to show and hide <dialog>
the same time you are opening the modal, you should put the large image to the <img> in the modal.
Don't forget to add alt attribute.
use <span> inside <dialog> to close the modal.
